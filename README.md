Project: Stock Price Prediction Engine

Proposal: When deciding what stocks to buy, investors must make an educated guess about how stocks will perform in the future. Our stock price prediction engine uses machine learning to predict the future prices of target stocks, giving investors another tool in their due diligence arsenals.
